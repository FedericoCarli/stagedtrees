## stagedtrees 

### Use

- install with
  `devtools::install_github("https://github.com/gherardovarando/stagedtrees")`
- 

### Dev

- Creating a project with Rstudio on the cloned folder is the easier way to
develop. 
- `testthat` is used to test the package, test can be run directly from
Rstudio.
- `roxygen2` is used to generate automatically the documentation from the
  block of comments before each function.

In general check [Wickham's R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) to learn
how to develop R packages.
